        * AAU I would like to be able to pull asset/inventory details from a pre-populated list, so I do not have to look up specifications elsewhere.
        * AAU I would like to be able to be able to access the data from my assets list from separate applications, or locations outside of inVent, because this information is pertinent for reporting, finances, etc.
        * AAU I would like to be able to filter my assets by different their different properties, because I need to be able to display all of a certain type, all listed on a certain day, etc...
